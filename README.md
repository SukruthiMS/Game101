There are two characteristics here called Giga who is escaping from a Haunting castle where he comes across a scary skeleton and tries to run from it but also has to collect apples . Now this is where he needs your help.. U need to help him by collect as may apples as u can by  pointing ur mouse at the apples to collect them and at the same time make sure not to collide with the skeleton or giga will lose a part of his soul every time the sketeton touches him and eventually disappear .Hope u enjoy
