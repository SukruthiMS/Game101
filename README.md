# Game time 
Hi everyone !!
Here is a game made in Scratch using simple blocks of code.
There are two characteristics here called Giga who is escaping from a Haunting castle where he comes across a scary skeleton and tries to run from it but also has to collect apples . Now this is where he needs your help.. U need to help him collect as may apples as u can.
u need to use the ur mouse to point at the apples to collect at the same time make sure not to collide with the skeleton or giga will lose a part of every time the sketeton touches him.Hope u enjoy 

This game is in sb3 format . 
u need to go to scratch i.e https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted 
and click on File>Load from your computer > 
and upload the file which u have downloaded 

Enjoy !! :)
