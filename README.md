Hi everyone !!
Here is a game made in Scratch using simple blocks of code.
There are two characteristics here called Giga who is escaping from a Haunting castle where he comes across a scary skeleton and tries to run from it but as its becoming dark giga finds it difficult to travel home . Now this is where he needs your help.. U need to help him find his way by pointing the pionter in the right direction or else every time the sketeton touches him , he looses his part of soul .

This game is in sb3 format . 
u need to go to scratch i.e https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted 
and click on File>Load from your computer > 
and upload the file which u have downloaded 

Enjoy !! :)
